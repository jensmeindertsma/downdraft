# downdraft

Implementation of Fly.io's [Gossip Glomers](https://fly.io/dist-sys/) distributed systems challenges.

## Setting up

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/01-getting-ready/index.md) to set up Maelstrom and its dependencies. You can place Maelstrom wherever you like but I just have a `maelstrom` folder with all the unzipped contents in the root of this repository. It is conveniently ignored in the Git ignore file. Once you are able to run the demo, you should be able to run Maelstrom on the binaries in this project.

## Reference material

The full protocol specification can be found [here](https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/protocol.md).
